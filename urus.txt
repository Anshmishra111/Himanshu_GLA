Whereas the original Lamborghini Urus marked the brand’s arrival into the modern high-performance SUV segment, the 2025 Urus takes a similar step into the brave new world of electrification. Specifically, the new-for-2025 Urus SE employs a plug-in hybrid (PHEV) powertrain: a twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 provides the internal combustion part of the equation, while a 192-hp electric motor represents the electric component. The peak combined output is an impressive 789 horsepower. More than just a power grab, the hybrid powertrain takes some of the peaks and valleys out of the torque curve, which should improve tractability. The smallish 25.7-kWh battery pack provides the option of EV-only operation, and while no official range figures are available, Lamborghini hints its European-spec rating will be 37 miles, which will probably be reduced to approximately 21 miles in EPA testing. Otherwise, the Urus SE receives a roster of exterior cosmetic and tech updates, including a restyled liftgate, front and rear diffusers, and a mildly updated interior that doesn’t stray too far from the previous gas-powered Urus. In short, the Urus SE delivers all the same aggressive Lamborghini style and swagger—packaged in a four-door SUV body—as ever, but with the added benefit of EV-only operation and a more versatile torque curve. For buyers who aren't quite ready for a hybrid Lamborghini, the Urus S and Urus Performante will continue into 2025 unchanged, but this model year will be their last.
